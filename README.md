## Interview Preparation  
### General Knowledge:
* What is DevOps and what is the benefit of using it?  
  ***DevOps is the combination of development and operations, previously when these roles***  
  ***were separate inter-team conflicts were common place. However, when combined the service***  
  ***life cycle becomes more efficient as the whole team is working together instead of lowering***  
  ***inter-team disputes and increasing the rate of development.***  

* What is Agile and what is the benefit of implementing it?  
  ***Agile is a development methodology that emphasizes transparency, response to change and***  
  ***continuous delivery. The benefit of this is that the project can be changed based on the needs***  
  ***of the client, it also helps with time management and allows for greater flexibility through***  
  ***modularity***  

* Why did you choose Sparta Global?  
  ***I chose Sparta Global because of both their impressive growth over the last 5 years, with the***  
  ***company having doubled their employee count and their awe-inspiring list of reputable clients.***  
  ***I value the experience and knowledge that I can gain from such a well reviewed and highly***  
  ***respected company.***  

* What is SCRUM and what is the benefit of implementing it?  
  ***SCRUM is an implementation of agile which uses regular sprints consisting of user stories as***  
  ***well as retrospectives to increment through a project on a regular basis It's beneficial because***  
  ***it's highly adaptive to new requirements, and it is fully transparent. This allows every user to***  
  ***have a broad understanding of the work that must be achieved and how they should implement***  
  ***it.***  

* Where do you see yourself in 2-5 years time?  
  ***For the next two years I intend to pursue the opportunities given to me by Sparta Global as a***  
  ***DevOps consultant. After that I would like to progress to being a full time DevOps engineer,***  
  ***ideally with the company I am eventually contracted to. I then intend to grow my knowledge and***  
  ***skills for 2-3 years and eventually pursue a role as a senior DevOps engineer. However, if an***  
  ***opportunity comes along that I find attractive, I could see myself leaving this path for another.***  


### SQL:  
* What is a JOIN?  
  ***A JOIN is a clause that is used to combine two or more tables based on the relationship between***  
  ***two columns. This is extremely useful as it allows for the extraction of very specific data from a***  
  ***large database.***  

* What are primary keys and foreign key? What are they used for?  
  ***A primary key is a unique immutable column of values used to identify each row in a table. A foreign***  
  ***key is a column of values that are used in a join statement to unite two tables along a column of***  
  ***corresponding values.***    

* What are DML, DDL, DCL and TCL?  
  ***DML, DDL, DCL and TCL are all subsets of the language SQL each of which concerning a type of***  
  ***interaction with the database. DDL consists of commands focused on Defining the structure of the***  
  ***database, DML consists of commands focused on the manipulation of the contents of pre-defined***  
  ***tables, DCL consists of commands focused on management of permissions to clients and finaly TCL***  
  ***consists of commands focused on managing the changes that are made when using DML commands.***   

* What is normalisation?  
  ***Normalisation is a set of 'forms' used when creating databases in order to reduce data redundancy***  
  ***and to prevent the use of undesirable INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE queries***  

* What is an entity relationship diagram and what is it used for?  
  ***An entity relationship diagram is a diagram that displays the structure of a database, including the***  
  ***various relationships between the tables that make up a database. It's used to both plan the structure***  
  ***of a database and as a reference to construct queries that will be the most effective for that database.***   


### GIT:  
* What is GIT and what are the benefits of using it?  
  ***GIT is a version control system that allows users to make recorded changes to code. The benefit of this***  
  ***is that you can easily roll back code to a functional state in the event of a build failure or something***  
  ***simmilar***  


### OOP: 
* What is Object-Oriented Programming?  
  ***Object-Oriented programming is a variant of programming that organizes software design around***  
  ***the creation of objects rather than functions. It uses the four pillars of OOP to keep code as efficient***  
  ***and DRY as possible.***  
  
* What are the benefits of OOP?  
  ***One of the major benefits of using OOP is that it allows developers to keep their code as DRY as possible,***  
  ***by which I mean it allows them to create code in a re-usable format. This is extremly beneficial because***  
  ***it means that the creation of code is far more efficient than it would be without using OOP and therefore***  
  ***a developer can create a minimum amount of code with a maximum amount of usability. Futhermore OOP***  
  ***is inherently far more modular than traditional code meaning that problems are usually far easier to fix***  
  ***and changes are far easier to manage.***

* Can you tell me a use case for OOP?  
  ***One use case for OOP would be in game development, modern games are very large programs that without***  
  ***OOP would be nearly impossible create and maintain. OOP solves this problem by enacting its four pillars,***  
  ***say for example I wanted to create a goblin enemy. Without OOP I would have to create each one individually***  
  ***but with OOP I can define a class and then make as many instances of that class as I want or as many variants***  
  ***of that class as I desire using polymorphism and inheritance.***  
  
* What are the four pillars of OOP?
  
  
* Describe Abstraction
  
  
* Describe Inheritance
  
  
* Describe Encapsulation
  
  
* Describe Polymorphism
