## Interview Preparation  
### General Knowledge:
* Tell me about yourself  
  ***make it more personal, hobbies and achievments / volunteering***  
  ***Hi my name is Ben, I have a real passion for technology which lead me to graduating from Essex***  
  ***University with a bachelor's degree in computer science. During my time at university I***  
  ***specialised in programming-oriented topics such as Python, Java, SQL and C#. I used my skills***  
  ***to complete my final year project which was about using neural network technology and Image***  
  ***manipulation to identify the presence of malaria in images of blood cells. To achieve this, I***  
  ***used new technologies such as Tensorflow with NVIDEA CUDA in python to create a customised***  
  ***process for image classification. Using an agile approach I managed to create a neural network***  
  ***that was capable of discerning infection status of a blood cell with 99% accuracy. I have joined***  
  ***Sparta Global in the hopes of expanding my skillset to pursue a career as a Junior DevOps engineer***  
  ***and consultant.***  


* What is a weakness of yours?
  ******


* What is DevOps and what is the benefit of using it?  
  ***DevOps is the combination of development and operations, previously when these roles***  
  ***were separate inter-team conflicts were common place. However, when combined the service***  
  ***life cycle becomes more efficient as the whole team is working together instead of lowering***  
  ***inter-team disputes and increasing the rate of development.***  


* What skills should a consultant have and how have you learnt them?
  *** ***


* Why did you choose Sparta Global?  
  ***I chose Sparta Global because of both their impressive growth over the last 5 years, with the***  
  ***company having doubled their employee count and their awe-inspiring list of reputable clients.***  
  ***I value the experience and knowledge that I can gain from such a well reviewed and highly***  
  ***respected company.***  


* Where do you see yourself in 2-5 years time?  
  ***For the next two years I intend to pursue the opportunities given to me by Sparta Global as a***  
  ***DevOps consultant. After that I would like to progress to being a full time DevOps engineer,***  
  ***ideally with the company I am eventually contracted to. I then intend to grow my knowledge and***  
  ***skills for 2-3 years and eventually pursue a role as a senior DevOps engineer. However, if an***  
  ***opportunity comes along that I find attractive, I could see myself leaving this path for another.***  


### Agile:  
* What is Agile and what is the benefit of implementing it?  
  ***Agile is a development methodology that emphasizes transparency, response to change and***  
  ***continuous delivery. The benefit of this is that the project can be changed based on the needs***  
  ***of the client, it also helps with time management and allows for greater flexibility through***  
  ***modularity***  


* What are the four values of agile?
  *** ***


* What is SCRUM and what is the benefit of implementing it?  
  ***SCRUM is an implementation of agile which uses regular sprints consisting of user stories as***  
  ***well as retrospectives to increment through a project on a regular basis. It's beneficial because***  
  ***it's highly adaptive to new requirements, and it is fully transparent. This allows every user to***  
  ***have a broad understanding of the work that must be achieved and how they should implement***  
  ***it.***  
  
  
* What are the three roles of scrum?  
  *** ***
 
 
* What are the SCRUM artifacts?  
  *** ***


### SQL:  
* What is a JOIN?  
  ***A JOIN is a clause that is used to combine two or more tables based on the relationship between***  
  ***two columns. This is extremely useful as it allows for the extraction of very specific data from a***  
  ***large database.***  


* What are primary keys and foreign key? What are they used for?  
  ***A primary key is a unique immutable column of values used to identify each row in a table. A foreign***  
  ***key is a column of values that are used in a join statement to unite two tables along a column of***  
  ***corresponding values.***    


* What are DML, DDL, DCL and TCL?  
  ***DML, DDL, DCL and TCL are all subsets of the language SQL each of which concerning a type of***  
  ***interaction with the database. DDL consists of commands focused on Defining the structure of the***  
  ***database, DML consists of commands focused on the manipulation of the contents of pre-defined***  
  ***tables, DCL consists of commands focused on management of permissions to clients and finally TCL***  
  ***consists of commands focused on managing the changes that are made when using DML commands.***   


* What is normalisation?  
  ***Normalisation is a set of 'forms' used when creating databases in order to reduce data redundancy***  
  ***and to prevent the use of undesirable INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE queries***  


* What is an entity relationship diagram and what is it used for?  
  ***An entity relationship diagram is a diagram that displays the structure of a database, including***  
  ***the various relationships between the tables that make up a database. It's used to both plan the***  
  ***structure of a database and as a reference to construct queries that will be the most effective***  
  ***for that database.***   


### GIT:  
* What is GIT and what are the benefits of using it?  
  ***GIT is a version control system that allows users to make recorded changes to code. The benefit***  
  ***of this is that you can easily roll back code to a functional state in the event of a build failure***  
  ***or something similar***  


### API:
* What is an API and what are the benefits of using it?  
  ***An API or Application programming inteface is an intemediary***


### OOP: 
* What is Object-Oriented Programming?  
  ***Object-Oriented programming is a variant of programming that organizes software design around***  
  ***the creation of objects rather than functions. It uses the four pillars of OOP to keep code as***  
  ***efficient and DRY as possible.***  
  

* What are the benefits of OOP?  
  ***One of the major benefits of using OOP is that it allows developers to keep their code as DRY as***  
  ***possible, by which I mean it allows them to create code in a re-usable format. This is extremly***  
  ***beneficial because it means that the creation of code is far more efficient than it would be without***  
  ***using OOP and therefore a developer can create a minimum amount of code with a maximum amount of***  
  ***usability. Furthermore, OOP is inherently far more modular than traditional code meaning that problems***  
  ***are usually far easier to fix and changes are far easier to manage.***  


* Can you tell me a use case for OOP?  
  ***One use case for OOP would be in game development, modern games are very large programs that without***  
  ***OOP would be nearly impossible create and maintain. OOP solves this problem by enacting its four***  
  ***pillars, say for example I wanted to create a goblin enemy. Without OOP I would have to create each***  
  ***one individually but with OOP I can define a class and then make as many instances of that class***  
  ***as I want or as many variants of that class as I desire using polymorphism and inheritance.***  
  

* What are the four pillars of OOP?  
  ***The four pillars of OOP are four essential concepts that make OOP so effective. They are Abstraction,***  
  ***Inheritance, Encapsulation and Polymorphism.***  
  

* Describe Abstraction  
  ***Abstraction is the idea of hiding non-essential information from the outside world, a great example***  
  ***of this is the smartphone. It's not required that the end user actually understands how it works,***  
  ***all they are concerned with is that it DOES work.***  
  

* Describe Inheritance  
  ***Inheritance is the act of creating a new class based on a class you have already made, it allows***  
  ***this new sub-class to inherit the attributes and methods of the parent class without the developer***  
  ***having to write it all again. This provides a high efficiency way of re-using code in related classes.***
  
  
* Describe Encapsulation  
  ***Encapsulation binds related data into containers that make it easier to manage and protect, it is***  
  ***an essential part of OOP that many of the other pillars rely on. The modularity that it provides***  
  ***allows for ease of use and ease of modification.***

  
* Describe Polymorphism  
  ***Polymorphism means "many forms", it is used when defining a behaviour or value that overwrites a***  
  ***pre-existing value or behaviour. For example if I created 
  
  
### TDD:  
* What is TDD and what are the benefits of using it?  
  ***TDD means Test Driven Development. TDD is a development methodology that allows for the fast and***  
  ***effective testing of code using unit tests. The benefit of using this methodology is that in the***  
  ***event of a code breaking change, developers can easily localise and fix the problem. Futhermore, when***  
  ***using CI/CD these tests can be used to automatically ensure a non-functional product doesn't replace***  
  ***a current functional one.***
